## 🔧 Withdrawal Mechanism

### 📋 How It Works:
1. **Balance Types**: MarginAccount maintains two balance categories:
   - **Free Balance**: Available for withdrawal
   - **Locked Balance**: Used as margin for active positions

2. **Withdrawal Function**: `MarginAccount.withdraw(amount)`
   - **Access**: Direct user call
   - **Requirement**: `amount <= freeBalance`
   - **Destination**: User's wallet address
   - **Gas**: Standard transaction fee

### 🎛️ Technical Implementation:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant nonZeroAmount(amount) {
    if (freeBalance[msg.sender] < amount) {
        revert InsufficientFreeBalance();
    }
    
    // Update balances
    freeBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    totalBalance -= amount;
    
    // Transfer USDC to user
    USDC.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, freeBalance[msg.sender]);
}
```

## ✅ What Users CAN Withdraw

### 💰 Free Balance:
- **Amount**: Currently 2635 USDC available
- **Status**: ✅ Immediately withdrawable
- **Method**: `MarginAccount.withdraw(amount)`
- **Limit**: Up to the full free balance amount

### 📈 Example Withdrawal Commands:
```typescript
// Withdraw 100 USDC
await marginAccount.write.withdraw([parseUnits("100", 6)]);

// Withdraw 1000 USDC  
await marginAccount.write.withdraw([parseUnits("1000", 6)]);

// Withdraw all free balance
const freeBalance = await marginAccount.read.freeBalance([userAddress]);
await marginAccount.write.withdraw([freeBalance]);
```

## ❌ What Users CANNOT Withdraw

### 🔒 Locked Balance:
- **Amount**: Currently 110 USDC
- **Status**: ❌ Cannot withdraw directly
- **Reason**: Used as margin for active Position #2
- **Solution**: Close positions or reduce margin first

### 🔄 To Free Up Locked Balance:
1. **Close Positions**: 
   ```bash
   bun run closePositionManaged.ts 2 100  # Close position fully
   ```

2. **Remove Margin from Positions**:
   ```bash
   bun run removeMargin.ts 2 50  # Remove 50 USDC margin
   ```

## 🚀 User Guide: How to Withdraw Free Margin

### Step 1: Check Available Balance
```bash
bun run quickPortfolio.ts
```
Look for "Free Balance" - this is withdrawable.

### Step 2: Create Withdrawal Script
```typescript
import { MarginAccount } from './contracts';

// Withdraw 500 USDC
const amount = parseUnits("500", 6);
const tx = await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: marginAccountAddress,
  abi: marginAccountAbi,
  functionName: 'withdraw',
  args: [amount]
});
```

### Step 3: Execute Withdrawal
The USDC will be transferred directly to your wallet.
